/**
 * Handler interface that is invoked after a cancel on disconnect timeout for an acceptor session.
 *
 * In order for this handler to be invoked:
 * <ul>
 *  <li>The FIX session must have a cancel on disconnect type configured that requires a cancel on either logout,
 *  disconnect or both. This may be be provided either via the logon message or the acceptor engine configuration</li>
 *  <li>The CODTimeoutWindow also specified in the logon message or acceptor engine defaults must have expired without
 *  a reconnect</li>
 * </ul>.
 *
 * To provide these values on the logon message your FIX session dictionary must contain a CancelOnDisconnectType
 * field and optionally a CODTimeoutWindow field. Each of these configuration options are checked by first taking
 * the value provided in the logon message if it is specified and otherwise taking it from the acceptor engine
 * configuration.
 *
 * You can see <a href="https://github.com/real-logic/artio/wiki/Cancel-On-Disconnect-Notification">the wiki</a>
 * for more details around Cancel on disconnect support.
 *
 * Initiator implementations using cancel on disconnect can set the requisite logon fields using a
 * {@link SessionCustomisationStrategy}.
 *
 * The FIXP equivalent to this interface is {@link uk.co.real_logic.artio.fixp.FixPCancelOnDisconnectTimeoutHandler}.
